Reach Goals:
- Timed Power-Up (invincibility runs out after 30 seconds)

How to WIN:

> Goal is to get all 5 coins (this gives invincibility) and get to the treasure
	without bumping into more than 2 pirates

> Go south from the starting room for the first coin

> Go back up, then east for the second coin

> Go south from there, and go to the east end of the room for the third coin

> Go back to the crossroads room (where the second coin was) and go north, entering the maze

> It is a bit tricky to explain the maze layout but, go straight north until you hit a wall, 
	then go east, fourth coin is in the second to last hall/turn (can be seen on map file that was provided)
	
> Go back the way you came, then just as you enter the maze, turn east and just keep going
	then turn north at the end, then east again at the turn. Final coin is in that room.
	
> Hurry back to the crossroads room and keep going east from there. You are supposed to use
	your invincibility to break thru the lines of pirates and get to the treasure on the other side,
	but be quick, invincibility only lasts 30 seconds, and when it runs out there's no other way to get it!
